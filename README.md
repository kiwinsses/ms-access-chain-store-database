**Long description of the task:**
Auto Parts Store Chain Project

An auto parts store chain has a central management system that maintains a database of the chain's operations. The auto parts sold in the stores are manufactured by various producers (the same part can be produced by multiple manufacturers) and are intended for different car brands and models (the same part can be suitable for more than one model or even more than one brand). Each auto part can be ordered from the manufacturer, and each part can also be returned to the manufacturer in case of defects.

Develop a database that facilitates the information management of the described operations. At the end of each business day, every store provides a detailed report of the sold parts, both on paper and as a sales table created in Access. The stores are supplied with parts daily, and they also send requests for auto parts and defect reports that need to be compiled for each manufacturer and sent with a cover letter at the beginning of the next business day (due to postal services).

Examples of common queries in this process:
1. In which stores have seat belts manufactured by company "X" been delivered, and when?
2. Which stores currently have carburetors for VAZ carsâ€”address and phone number?
3. How many defect reports are there for parts produced by each manufacturer?
4. Which part has received the most orders in the past three years?
5. How many spare parts for all BMW models are currently available in the chain's stores?
